    "  * Always edit py files, treat the ipynb files as read only output storage\n",
    "  * If you  forget, you can sync with: `jupytext --sync thenotebook.py`\n",
    "  * or sync and execute: `jupytext --sync --execute thenotebook.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "To get familiar with how jupytext works, it would be good \n",

    "The notes below show how to bootstrap a repository with notebooks only committed\n",
    "as python files.  That means that the first time through, we need to convert and\n",

    "1. Install miniconda if you don't have it -- note that our environment\n",
    "   will be 100% conda-forge, so you don't want to use a large existing\n",
    "   anaconda installation to create the numeric environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. clone the repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/phaustin/numeric\n",
    "cd numeric\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should put a `jupyter_notebook_config.py` file in your `~/.jupyter` folder\n",

    "\n",
    "To build from scratch, we need to convert the py files to ipynb files.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cd numeric`\n",
    "2. `python scripts/find_notebooks.py notebooks notebook_filelist.json --initial`\n",
    "\n",
    "This should create an ipynb file for every py file and a new json\n",
    "file calle `notebook_filelist.json`.  We need to execute\n",
    "these, at this point we can suppress all errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python scripts/jup_build.py exec-noerrors-nb notebook_filelist.json`\n",

    "Repeat this for the docs notebooks:\n",

    "deploy with github-pages:\n",

    "1. `cd numeric/docs`\n",

    "We have a separate repo to maintain the notebooks and libraries that the students will\n",
    "download:  https://github.com/phaustin/numeric_students\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is a mirror of everything that is in our [students folder](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/tree/master/students).  My workflow for deploying\n",
    "to this folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. add a no-passphrase public key to the numeric_students repository (mine is named new_pha_git)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I put the following entry into my .ssh/config:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Host phaustin\n",

    "```\n",
    "git add remote students phaustin:phaustin/numeric_students\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now you can use ghp-import to push the students folder to that remote using [push_students.sh](https://github.com/phaustin/numeric/blob/master/scripts/push_students.sh)\n",

    "Note that I've removed the master branch from the repo and made \"downloads\" the default branch\n",
    "so we don't get confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important point -- you can commit new notebooks to the student folder as part of a numeric branch, but push_students.sh makes a separate commit of every file in the folder and completely overwrites the remote\n",
