Miniproject 2: Rabbits and foxes
--------------------------------

Add two new variables (one at a time) to Daisyworld, as specified in
Lab 5 question predator:

Variable 1) Concentration of rabbits that eat daisies
Variable 2) Concentration of foxes that eat rabbits

You'll need to come up with:

a) rabbit and fox birthrates
b) rabbit and fox deathrates
c) a rate at which rabbits eat daisies
d) a rate at which foxes eat rabbits

Note that while we've considered Aw and Ab to be non-dimensional
daisy concentrations (fractions of the planet covered).  They could
just as easily be daisies per square km.  In the same way
a fox "area" of 0.1 could be 0.1 foxes per square km, or
1 fox every 10 square km.

Try to find values for your initial concentrations and birth/death
and consumption rates that give an equilibrium in which
black/white daisies, rabbits and foxes can all coexist.  See if you
can get "predator-prey" oscillations, in which the fox and rabbit
populations go through periodic highs and lows.

In your writeup, state all your assumptions, and discuss i) your strategy
for finding the steady state ii) whether the various rates  are
reasonable, given what you know about daisies and mammals (e.g.
what do your birth and death rates tell you about the average lifespan of a 
fox or rabbit on your planet, or the number of rabbits
in a litter?)
